- **Your time:** 50-70 hours/month
- **Effective rate:** $1,143-$1,600/hr

### Aggressive (Month 12):
- **10 retainer clients** × $8K = $80K/month
- **3 medium projects** × $20K = $60K/month
- **Total:** $140K/month ($1.68M/year)

Team cost: $40K (2 devs × 2 weeks)
Overhead: $5K (office, tools, etc)

### Your Agentic Company:

## Economics Example: Your First $3K Project

**Traditional Development:**
- 40 hours of work needed
- Bill client: $3,000
- If you did it manually: lose money ($4K cost > $3K revenue)

**With Agents:**
- 8 hours of your actual work (review, client calls)
- Agents do 80% of coding, testing, deployment
- Bill client: $3,000
- Your cost: $800 (8 hours opportunity cost)
- **Profit: $2,200 (73% margin)**

**Same project at full price ($8K):**
- Still 8 hours of work
- Bill client: $8,000
- Your cost: $800
- **Profit: $7,200 (90% margin)**
