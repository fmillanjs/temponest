## 💰 The Opportunity

### Traditional SaaS Company:
```
Build time: 6 months
Team cost: $300,000 (3 engineers)
Break even: 18-24 months
Exit value: Based on ARR × 3-10x multiple
```

### Your Agentic SaaS Company:
```
Build time: 8 weeks
Cost: $5,000 (your time + servers)
Break even: 3-6 months  
Exit value: SAME as traditional (ARR × 3-10x)
```

**You save $295K and 18 weeks. Same exit potential.**
