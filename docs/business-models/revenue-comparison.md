## Model 5: HYBRID - The Best of All Worlds

### Strategy:
**Base: Monthly retainers** (predictable income)
**+ Project work** (high margin growth)

### Retainer Clients (8-10 clients × $5K = $40K-$50K/month):
```
What you provide monthly:
- Security scan (automated)
- Code review (1-2 PRs)
- Design consultation (1 meeting)
- 5 hours of ad-hoc dev work
- Priority support

Your actual time: 3-4 hrs/client/month = 25-40 hrs/month total
```

### Project Work (1-2/month = $20K-$80K/month):
```
Take on projects during slow retainer periods
- Small projects: $5K-$15K
- Medium projects: $25K-$50K
```

### Combined Revenue:
```
Month 1: $50K retainer + $30K projects = $80K
Month 2: $50K retainer + $60K projects = $110K
Month 3: $50K retainer + $20K projects = $70K

Quarterly Average: $86K/month ($1.03M/year)
```

### Time Breakdown:
- Retainer work: 30-40 hrs/month (mostly automated scans + review)
- Project work: 20-30 hrs/month (varies by project load)
- **Total: 50-70 hrs/month**

### Why This Works Best:
✅ **Predictable base income** (retainers)
✅ **Upside from projects** (can be selective)
✅ **Diversified risk** (not dependent on landing big projects)
✅ **Compound growth** (retainers grow steadily, projects boost)
✅ **Work/life balance** (control project load)
