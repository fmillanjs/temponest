## Economics

**Traditional Agency:**
- 320 hours × $150/hr = $48,000 cost
- Bill client: $50,000
- Profit: $2,000 (4%)

**Agentic Company (You):**
- 20 hours × $150/hr = $3,000 actual work
- Infrastructure: $500/month
- Bill client: $50,000
- Profit: $46,500 (93%)

**Scale:**
- Traditional: Max 2-3 projects/quarter (limited by team)
- Agentic: 10-15 projects/quarter (you're just reviewing agent output)
- Revenue: $500K-$750K/year with 1 person

## Client Deliverables

### What You Ship:
1. ✅ Source code (GitHub repo)
2. ✅ Documentation (README, API docs)
3. ✅ Tests (80%+ coverage)
4. ✅ Deployment setup (Docker + CI/CD)
5. ✅ Design files (Figma/mockups)
6. ✅ Security audit report
7. ✅ User research (personas, journey maps)

### Client Never Knows:
- 90% was generated by agents
- You spent 20 hours not 320
- Your "team" is just AI agents

## Quality Control Checklist

**Your Role (Human-in-the-Loop):**
- [ ] Review agent task breakdown (Overseer)
- [ ] Approve designs before development (Designer)
- [ ] Code review agent-generated code (Developer)
- [ ] Manual testing of critical paths (QA)
- [ ] Apply security fixes (Security Auditor)
- [ ] Client communication & project management
- [ ] Final polish & deployment

**Time Investment:** 15-25% of traditional development time
**Quality:** Matches or exceeds traditional agencies (with proper review)
